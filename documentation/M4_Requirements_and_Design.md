2. **Real-Time Location Processing**: The application must process **location updates in the background** with minimal battery consumption. This is essential to provide accurate and timely notifications to users while ensuring the app does not drain device resources excessively.
3. **Notification Accuracy**: The system must deliver push notifications to users within **2 seconds** of detecting task deadlines or proximity triggers. This ensures timely alerts, which are critical for user engagement and task management efficiency.
4. **Location Accuracy**: The app must use location data with an accuracy of at least **10 meters** to ensure proximity-based notifications and route planning are reliable and useful for the user.

## 4. Designs Specification

### **4.1. Main Components**
1. **User**
    - **Description**: Handles user authentication, account management, and interaction with the Android UI. Users log in via Google Authentication, manage their accounts, and access their cloud-saved tasks.
    - **Purpose**: Ensures secure access, allowing users to manage their profiles and seamlessly interact with the app. Google Authentication API was chosen for enhanced security and to reduce development overhead. User login information is also linked to database organization, serving as labels for storing and retrieving user-specific task data. 
2. **Task**
    - **Description**: Provides users with a comprehensive system to create, modify, and delete tasks while optimizing task execution through real-time geofencing and dynamic scheduling. The system continuously tracks user location to determine proximity to task locations, dynamically adjusting task order based on real-time conditions such as distance, priority levels, and deadlines.
    - **Purpose**: Enhances productivity by minimizing travel time and ensuring efficient task execution. Real-time geofencing defines virtual boundaries around task locations and triggers alerts when users enter or leave task zones, ensuring location-based task reminders. Task scheduling intelligently arranges tasks based on their geographic distribution and urgency, providing users with an optimized route for task completion. Automated notifications ensure that tasks are pushed to users at the right time, reducing manual intervention and improving overall efficiency. This was chosen because alternatives like an automated task system don't provide users with direct control over their tasks.

### **4.2. Databases**
- **MongoDB**
    - Description: A NoSQL Database
    - Purpose: Store user-created tasks so that the user can access their tasks across multiple devices. This was chosen because of its simplicity compared to relational databases as well as the resiliency NoSQL can provide against network interruptions.


### **4.3. External Modules**
1. **Google Map API**
    - Purpose: Handles location data, calculates distance, and aids navigation.
2. **Google Calendar API**
    - Purpose: Stores/manages the task scheduling and check scheduling conflict

### **4.4. Frameworks**
1. **AWS**
    - AWS offers high availability and pre-configured tools, and AWS EC2 reduces infrastructure management overhead.
2. **Docker**
    -   Docker ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments. It also reduces deployment times and optimizes resource usage.

2. **Real-Time Location Processing**: The application will use optimized background location tracking with adaptive update intervals, leveraging Google Map API on Android.
3. **Notification Accuracy**: A real-time event-driven architecture with WebSockets will be used to ensure push notifications are delivered within 2 seconds. Task deadlines and proximity triggers will be preprocessed to reduce computation overhead during runtime.
4. **Location Accuracy**: The app will integrate GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular network data to achieve at least 10-meter accuracy.

### **4.8. Main Project Complexity Design**
#### **Task Scheduling with Time Window Constraints**
- **Problem Definition**: Given a set of tasks (currently limited to within the same day) with location, start time, deadline, and estimated duration, the system must find the optimal order of execution to minimize travel time while ensuring all tasks are completed before their deadlines.
- **Challenges:**
    - The problem resembles the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with Time Windows, which is NP-hard.
    - Tasks may have overlapping or conflicting deadlines, requiring dynamic adjustments.
    - Optional real-time traffic data will give a more accurate estimate, but comes at a much higher performance cost.
- **Proposed Solution:**
    - Bruteforce approach + Early stopping:
        - Start from the current user location and recursively explore all possible combinations. If at any point an unfinished task can no longer be reached before end time, it will be stopped early to reduce unnecessary computation.
        - Given the number tasks is small (generally less than 6), the computation cost is manageable.
